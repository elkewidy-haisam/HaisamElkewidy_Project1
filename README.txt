For the first Udacity project, I used the following:

GVR SDK v1.60.0
Unity 2017.1.0f3

The Udacity Carnival is a VR Carnival application, designed to give you the experience of attending a carnival and playing three games:

1. The Wheel of Fortune
2. Coin Toss
3. Plinko

By scoring enough points in the Wheel of Fortune, you can win a teddy bear. Watch out for it though, as it is likely to fall
down and land directly in front of you.
